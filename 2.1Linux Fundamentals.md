### 🔐 File Permissions & Ownership

Every file in Linux has permissions and an owner. Use `ls -l` to check them:

```bash
-rwxr-xr-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1024 Apr 29 12:00 script.sh
r = read, w = write, x = execute

Owner: ubuntu, Group: ubuntu 


chmod +x script.sh             # Add execute permission
chmod 755 deploy.sh            # rwx for owner, rx for group and others
chown devops:devops app.py     # Change owner and group
ls -l                          # View detailed permissions
