### üì∂ OSI Model

The **OSI Model** has 7 layers. Each layer serves a specific role in communication between two devices.

| Layer | Name        | Example                                |
|-------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 7     | Application | Web browser (HTTP), Email (SMTP)       |
| 6     | Presentation| Data encryption (SSL/TLS)              |
| 5     | Session     | Managing connection sessions (APIs)    |
| 4     | Transport   | TCP for web, UDP for DNS               |
| 3     | Network     | IP addressing and routing (192.168.x.x)|
| 2     | Data Link   | MAC address, switches                  |
| 1     | Physical    | Cables, NICs, fiber                    |

**Example**:  
When you open `https://www.google.com`, your browser (Application layer) uses TCP (Transport), which routes data via your router (Network), through an Ethernet cable (Physical).

## üåê IP Addressing ‚Äì Explained for Beginners

IP addressing is the foundation of communication in computer networks. Every device connected to a network is assigned a unique **IP address**.

---

### üß† What is an IP Address?

An **IP address (Internet Protocol address)** is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network.

There are **two versions** of IP addresses:
- **IPv4**: `192.168.1.10` (Most common, 32-bit)
- **IPv6**: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` (Newer, 128-bit)

---

### üßÆ IPv4 Address Format

IPv4 addresses have **4 octets** separated by dots (`.`).  
Each octet ranges from **0 to 255**.

**Example:**
192.168.0.1

This format is called **dotted decimal notation**.

### üè∑Ô∏è IP Address Classes (IPv4)

| Class | Range            | Usage                        |
|-------|------------------|------------------------------|
| A     | 1.0.0.0 ‚Äì 126.0.0.0  | Large networks               |
| B     | 128.0.0.0 ‚Äì 191.255.0.0 | Medium-sized networks         |
| C     | 192.0.0.0 ‚Äì 223.255.255.0 | Small networks               |
| D     | 224.0.0.0 ‚Äì 239.255.255.255 | Multicast (not for host use) |
| E     | 240.0.0.0 ‚Äì 255.255.255.255 | Reserved for research        |

---

### üè† Private vs Public IPs

- **Private IPs**: Used in internal/local networks
  - Ranges:
    - `10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255`
    - `172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255`
    - `192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255`
  - Example: `192.168.1.100`

- **Public IPs**: Routable over the internet  
  - Example: `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)

---

### üßÆ Subnet Mask

A **subnet mask** defines which portion of the IP is the **network** and which is the **host**.

| Subnet Mask      | CIDR | IP Range                | Hosts    |
|------------------|------|-------------------------|----------|
| 255.255.255.0     | /24  | 192.168.1.0 ‚Äì 192.168.1.255 | 254      |
| 255.255.0.0       | /16  | 192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255 | 65,534   |
| 255.0.0.0         | /8   | 10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255 | 16 million |

**Example:**
- IP: `192.168.1.10`
- Subnet: `/24` (255.255.255.0)
- Network Address: `192.168.1.0`
- Broadcast Address: `192.168.1.255`

### üåê TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP/S

| Protocol | Description                          | Example                           |
|----------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| TCP      | Reliable, connection-oriented        | File transfer, SSH                |
| UDP      | Fast, no guarantee of delivery       | Video streaming, DNS              |
| DNS      | Domain name ‚Üí IP address             | `google.com` ‚Üí `142.250.190.78`   |
| HTTP/S   | Web protocol (HTTP over SSL = HTTPS) | `https://www.github.com`          |

**Example**:  
When you visit `https://github.com`, your system first uses **DNS** to resolve the domain, then connects via **TCP** to exchange HTTP data.

---

### üîê SSH, FTP, Telnet

#### ‚úÖ SSH (Secure Shell)
Used for secure access to remote systems.

```bash
ssh user@192.168.1.10
```
Example: Connect to a remote Linux server securely.

üìÅ FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
Used to upload/download files.
```bash
ftp ftp.example.com
```
Example: Access website files on a hosting server.

‚ö†Ô∏è Telnet
Legacy tool for remote login (insecure, not encrypted).

```bash
telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
```
Fun example: Watch Star Wars in ASCII!

üî• Firewalls & Port Management
üîπ UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
```bash

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable

# Allow SSH on port 22
sudo ufw allow 22

# Allow HTTP
sudo ufw allow 80

# Check status
sudo ufw status
```
## üîå Common Ports Explained

In networking, **ports** allow your system to communicate with different services. Each service listens on a specific port number.

| Port | Protocol | Service               | Description & Example                                   |
|------|----------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 20   | TCP      | FTP (Data Transfer)   | Used for transferring data in FTP file transfers         |
| 21   | TCP      | FTP (Command Control) | Login and control commands for FTP                       |
| 22   | TCP      | SSH                   | Secure remote login. `ssh user@server`                   |
| 23   | TCP      | Telnet                | Insecure remote login (mostly deprecated)                |
| 25   | TCP      | SMTP                  | Sending emails (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)           |
| 53   | TCP/UDP  | DNS                   | Resolving domain names to IPs                            |
| 80   | TCP      | HTTP                  | Accessing websites over the internet                     |
| 110  | TCP      | POP3                  | Receiving email (Post Office Protocol v3)                |
| 143  | TCP      | IMAP                  | Managing and retrieving emails from mail servers         |
| 443  | TCP      | HTTPS                 | Secure websites. `https://example.com`                   |
| 3306 | TCP      | MySQL                 | Accessing MySQL databases                                |
| 3389 | TCP      | RDP                   | Remote desktop protocol (Windows remote access)          |
| 6379 | TCP      | Redis                 | Key-value database access                                |
| 8080 | TCP      | HTTP (Alt)            | Often used by apps as an alternative to port 80          |

### üõ†Ô∏è Example: Open a Port Using UFW

To allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
```
To allow SSH (for remote login):

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22

```
To view currently open ports and listening services:

```bash
sudo ss -tuln

```
Example output:
nginx
```
Netid State  Local Address:Port  Peer Address:Port
tcp   LISTEN 0.0.0.0:22         0.0.0.0:*      # SSH
tcp   LISTEN 0.0.0.0:80         0.0.0.0:*      # HTTP
tcp   LISTEN 0.0.0.0:443        0.0.0.0:*      # HTTPS
```
üîç Why Do Ports Matter in DevOps?
Ensuring security by blocking unused ports

Opening only required ports for web servers, databases, etc.

Diagnosing service issues (e.g., web server down if port 80 isn't open)
